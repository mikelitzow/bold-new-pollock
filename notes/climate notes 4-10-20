climate analysis notes 4/10/20

AICc plots show strong evidence of changing relationships between large-scale modes and Bering climate (DFA)

Correlation between DFA trend and Arctic SLP shows weakening post-88/89 (maps)

BUT! no real change in relationships among the regional variables!!

Stan fits show changing relationships (mostly intercepts!) with DFA

Need to fit stan models to large-scale modes and leading regional variables (those loading most strongly on DFA trend)

Then! Fit DFA to biology TS...
