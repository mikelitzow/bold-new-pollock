Objectives outlined in the PCCRC proposal:

Objective 1.	Develop predictive statistical models, based on SEBS data, to better understand recent and potential future changes in the distribution, abundance, and weight at age of walleye pollock in the context of changing climate dynamics and changing species interactions. In order to develop better models, this objective will involve the following sub-objectives:

a.	Test for non-stationary relationships among climate drivers in the Bering Sea.

b.	Test for non-stationary relationships in the abundance of pollock and other common species in the demersal community on the Bering Sea shelf.

c.	Incorporate these non-stationary relationships in predictive models of pollock weight at age, distribution, and abundance.

Objective 2.	Assess predictive ability of the SEBS model for explaining recent weight at age, abundance and distribution trends in the NBS and, by extension, how useful the model might be for predicting future changes in the NBS.
